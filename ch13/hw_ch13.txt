Q1. Free is a Linux command line tool that tells us 
about the amount of total, free and used physical memory in the system.

Q2. Output of free -m in Khoury Linux servers:
bash-4.2$ free -m
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           7821        1562        1872          57        4385        5902
Swap:          8191           4        8187

Total memory = 7821 MB
Free = 1872 MB

Q3. See file memory-user.c for the code.

Q4. When we run memory-user program with lower amount of memory like
10 MB, the amount of free memory reported by free decreases by 10 MB and 
used memory increases by 10 MB. But when we use higher values of memory like 
100 MB the the amount of free memory reported by free does not decrease by 
100 exactly but decreases by a values like 94 or 93 MB. 

Q5. pmap reports virtual memory map of a process.

Q7. pmap shows the whole virtual memory address of a process starting with
code followed by heap and stack. We also see some other memory sections for
shared libraries, vdso and vsyscall entities.

Q8. We see that the memory used by the program increases as we specify higher
values while running memory-user. But the memory allocated by program is not 
always as expected like for memory-user 10 we use 9768 in heap for the array,
but for memory-user 10 we see 97660 in heap for array instead of 97680 as
expected.
