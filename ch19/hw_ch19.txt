Q1. See time.c for details. I'm using gettimeofday to measure the time taken
for page access. gettimeofday can measure time in microseconds. An operation 
has to be greater than 500000 microseconds in order to time it precisely.

Q2. see tlb.c

Q3. See script.sh for details. We need to run 500000000 number of trials for
reliable measurements.

Q4. Visualization gives us a pictorial representation of the data and the 
relation of data with respect to each other which makes the data easier to
digest.

Q5. We can do this by compiling the code with no optimisations.

Q6. We can do this using pthread_setaffinity_np function. If we dont do this
and the process moves from one cpu to another it will lead to more tlb misses
and some unexplained spikes in the graph at irregular intervals.

Q7. Not initialising the array before accesing it will lead to higher costs
 when the array is accessed for the first time. This will lead to a spike 
 in our cost graph for access of the first page. We can initialise the array
 with calloc to counterbalance these potential costs.
