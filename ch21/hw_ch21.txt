Q1. The cpu user time %age goes to 25% when we run mem. The %age of cpu time
used by user space goes to 50% when we run two instances of mem.

Q2. The swpd memory remains at zero when we run mem 1024. The amount of free 
memory decreases when we run mem to reflect the memory allocated for the array. 
When we stop mem the amount of free memory goes back to initial value as 
expected.

Q3. We get non zero values for swap in and out when running mem with values 
greater than 6000. The amount of memory swapped in and out decreases with 
subsequent loops. 
For higher memory the behaviour is different. When we run mem with 8000
we see higher values for swap in and out and the values remain high for 
subsequent loops. The value fluctuate from 30-40k for swap in and 10k to 70k 
for swap out.

Q4. CPU utilization increases when mem is running. Block IO statistics keeps
changing.

Q5. The performance is much better when everything can fit comfortably in 
memory ./mem 4000. The bandwith is around 5500 MB/s. First loop takes longer
than subsequent loops with bandwith of around 2500 MB/s. This is because the 
cache takes one loop to warm up and build entries in TLB for first loop and 
hence first loop takes longer, but subsequent are faster as we get more
TLB hit.

The performance is much worse when everything cannot fit comfortably in 
memory ./mem 9000. This is because we need to make use of swap space to 
run the program, which is much slower than physical memory. The bandwith is 
around 50 MB/s. First loop takes less time than subsequent loops with bandwith 
of around 1200 MB/s. 

See fig.png for the plot.

Q6. We have a swap space of around 8 GB in the system. Memory allocation fails
when I try to allocate 15000 MB. 

-bash-4.2$ ./mem 15000
allocating 15728640000 bytes (15000.00 MB)
memory allocation failed

Q7. Khoury Linux servers do not access to different devices.

-bash-4.2$ cat /etc/fstab

We can see from the output that we only have one swap:
