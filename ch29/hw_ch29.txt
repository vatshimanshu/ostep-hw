Q1. See time.c for details. I'm using gettimeofday to measure the time taken
for page access. gettimeofday can measure time in microseconds.

Q2. There are 8 cpus available in my mac. This does not impact our measurement.
Time take for 1 thread = 22541 micro seconds
Time take for 2 threads = 45213 micro seconds
Time take for 3 threads = 197052 micro seconds
Time take for 4 threads = 133311 micro seconds

Q3. threshold 1024
Time take for 1 thread = 24607 micro seconds
Time take for 2 thread = 69533 micro seconds
Time take for 3 thread = 98798 micro seconds
Time take for 4 thread = 134283 micro seconds

Threshold 1:
Time taken for 4 threads : 171174 micro seconds

Threshold 2:
Time taken for 4 threads : 147478 micro seconds

Threshold 4:
Time taken for 4 threads : 140613 micro seconds

The number are not as expceted.

Q4. Never. The overheads of acquiring and releasing locks for each node
of a list traversal is prohibitive.
